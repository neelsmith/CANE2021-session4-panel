# The panelists: biographies from the annual meeting program

*Neel Smith* is Professor and Chair of the Department of Classics at the College of the Holy Cross, and faculty advisor to the Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club, an undergradate research club whose members have presented papers at conferences in 10 countries. He is also co-architect of the Homer Multitext project,
a collaborative digital project studying the transmission of the Homeric poems. In 2019, he was selected by the Council on Undergraduate research as an inaugural recipient of its “Arts and Humanities Faculty Mentor Award.”


*Luke Giuntoli* is a fourth year student at the College of the Holy Cross. He is originally from Walnut Creek, CA, and has been fortunate enough to participate in the school’s Manuscripts, Inscriptions, and Documents club since his first semester of college. He also spent the last two summers conducting research on manuscripts of the Iliad with other students, including fellow panelist Sophia Sarro ‘21, under the supervision of Professor Smith. Luke plans on using this research to complete his thesis next semester: “The Mythological World of the Scholia.”

*Sophia Sarro* is a fourth year Classics student at the College of the Holy Cross. She has taken part in the school’s Manuscripts, Inscriptions, and Documents Club for the past four years, and has collaborated with her fellow students on two summer research projects pertaining to manuscripts. Throughout the past year, Sophia has worked alongside Professor Bird and Professor Smith to edit and translate several from manuscript sources several crucial texts relating to the critical signs used in Aristarchus’ commentary on the *Iliad*.

*Graeme Bird* teaches Linguistics and Classics at Gordon College, and mathematics (including Ancient Greek mathematics) at the Harvard Extension School. His interests include the history and transmission of the Homeric texts, both from the evidence preserved in the Ptolemaic papyri, and also the scholia and system of critical signs used in the Venetus A medieval manuscript of Homer’s Iliad. In addition he likes to explore possible relationships between jazz improvisation and Homeric “composition in performance.” He has led two previous CANE workshops, one in Homer/jazz, and the other in ancient Greek mathematics.
