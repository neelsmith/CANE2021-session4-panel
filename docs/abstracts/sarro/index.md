# Dionysius Thrax and an unnoticed aspect of technical language in the *scholia* to the *Iliad*

This paper explores a previously unstudied aspect of the technical language of the scholia. The scholia use the verbal adjective ending in -τέον when referring to necessary or obligatory aspects of the scholar’s work. I first show that when it is not referring to action in the story of the Iliad, this verbal adjective is used exclusively for the technical tasks of the grammatikos. That is, we can view the verbal adjective similarly to Dionysius’ explicit rules, explaining what the scholiast thought he or his readers must do in order to understand the text fully.

I then compare the activities described by this verb form with Dionysius’ six parts of the scholar’s art. While some terms correspond precisely to a single category, others describe actions that could apply to more than one of Dionysius’ concerns. I use topic modelling to identify ‘topics’ within the scholia, that is clusters of co- occurring words with no inherent meaning, but to which we can ascribe meaning based on relation between the words.

By analyzing how closely distinct topics align with the categories of literary-critical understanding laid out by Dionysius Thrax, we can see how the practice of commentary preserved in the scholia corresponds to the systematic definition of Dionysius.
