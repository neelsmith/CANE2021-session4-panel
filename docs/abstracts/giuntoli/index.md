# The mythological world of the scholia



Dionysius names as one component of the literary scholar’s work the “ready accounting for ἱστορίαι,” that is, the “back stories” that the Homeric reader is supposed to know. A survey of the sources cited by scholia using the terms ἱστορέω or ἱστορία shows that they draw on a wide range of sources earlier in date than Aristarchus, but only cite stories from later sources that are specifically focused on mythology or the Trojan War. This reflects a progressive narrowing of scholarly discussion to a canonical set of versions.

We also see that while ἱστορία scholia appear throughout the entire text, a significant number appear in Books 1 and 2 to provide context for the overall story. The ἱστορία scholia do not discuss events after the conclusion of the *Iliad*. As we will show with specific examples, this illustrates how the “ready accounting for ἱστορίαι” serves the grammarian’s larger aim of evaluating authentically Homeric material.
