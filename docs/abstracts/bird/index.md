# Critical signs and critical judgment: Aristonicus’ signs and Dionysius Thrax’s principles of literary judgment

The *Iliad* text of the Venetus A manuscript uniquely preserves a system of annotation with critical signs that was invented by Dionysius’ teacher, Aristarchus; Venetus A in addition is our only source for a fragment of the treatise *On Critical Signs* by Aristonicus. As this fragment shows, the critical signs focus the reader’s attention on textual and literary matters, such as whether specific lines should be considered “Homeric,” based on such criteria as various types of “appropriateness.” They allow us to see how the editorial work of Aristarchus was directed toward the ultimate goal of the literary scholar according to Dionysius, namely the “critical judgment of poetry.”
