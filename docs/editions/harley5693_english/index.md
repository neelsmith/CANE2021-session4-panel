> English translation by Graeme Bird, Sophia Sarro and Neel Smith.


|  | Normalized text  |
| :---: | :------ |
| `title` | About the signs handed down from Aristarchus applied to the text of Homer |
| `1` | Obelos. |
| `2` | Undotted diple. |
| `3` | Dotted diple. |
| `4` | Asterisk. |
| `5` | Asterisk with obelos. |
| `6` | Antisigma. |
| `7` | Two dots. |
| `8` | The obelos is applied in response to athetesis; |
| `9` | the undotted diple, in response to a figure of speech, a backstory, a foreign word, or other thing of that sort; |
| `10` | the dotted diple is applied in response to Zenodotian [mis]corrections; |
| `11` | the asterisk, in response to Homeric lines that are correctly placed; |
| `12` | the asterisk with the obelos is used when the lines are genuinely Homeric as is shown by the asterisk, but when they are out of place as indicated through the obelos; |
| `13` | the antisigma and two dots are applied whenever the same thought is present twice in succession. The antisigma is placed on the first occurrence, and the two dots on the second occurrence. |
