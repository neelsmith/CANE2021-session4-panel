# Editions

A small number of extant texts or fragments of texts discuss the usage of critical signs in Aristarchus' system.  Dindorf collected five of these  in volume 1 of his *Scholia Graeca in Homeri Iliadem*, pages xlii-l.
(A scan of this volume is available from archive.org, [here](https://archive.org/details/scholiagraecainh01homeuoft).)

Important manuscript sources for some of these texts are now available in openly licensed digital images.  We present new digital editions and English translations of two texts discussed in our panel:

1. **Aristonicus *On Signs***.  Folio 8 recto of the Venetus A manuscript (Venice, Marciana Library Z. 454 = 822) preserves a single page of Aristonicus' treatise *On Signs* (*Σημεῖα*). Although this work is cited at least 11 times in the manuscript's *scholia* to the *Iliad*, as well as named as a source after 22 of the 24 books of the *Iliad* text, this page is the only directly preserved fragment of the text.  It was certainly part of the original  tenth-century manuscript, but like the other material represented in the jumbled pages of the manuscript's first eleven folios, was only preserved in the manuscript's later rebindings.
2. ***On Aristarchus' Signs Annotating Homer***.  The British Library's Harley MS 5693 is a fourteenth-century manuscript of the *Iliad* with *scholia*.  Among the preliminary materials included in the first twenty-two folios of the manuscript is a summary listing of the forms and meaning of Aristarchus' signs, headed *περὶ τῶν παρ' ἀρϊστάρχου σημήων παρατιθεμένων τῶ ὁμήρω*.  (For more information, see the [British Library's site](https://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Harley_MS_5693).)

Our editions of both texts include links to images illustrasting each passage of text.
